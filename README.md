Use a refund token
If you’re only wondering how you can earn free V-Bucks because you spent your last one on a skin that you didn’t like, fear not. All Fortnite accounts are granted three refund tokens, which allow them to return the cosmetics they bought and get back their precious V-Bucks.

This method only gives you back the V-Bucks that you spent on the skin that you return, though, and the cap on tokens will limit their usage. It’s still worth using them to get your V-Bucks back for a purchase that you weren’t satisfied with.

Every year, players will be given one refund token. This change was implemented in Patch 18.2. Before that, players would run out of refunds forever after using all of them.

Though accidental purchases happen, a refund system such as this one is necessary to prevent players from abusing the system. If that wasn’t the case, most players would purchase a skin and wear it for a few days only to refund it, which would damage Epic’s revenue stream.

Honorable mentions
These methods aren’t entirely free, but if you’re already going to spend money on Fortnite, you might as well follow them to get more bang for your buck.

Unlock the V-Bucks rewards in your battle pass
The battle pass itself costs money, but you can earn back your investment and then some. Fortnite has been allowing players to only unlock the tiers that they like in the battle pass, meaning players can unlock the V-Buck rewards immediately if they have enough Battle Stars.

Once you start profiting from your initial battle pass investment, you can save up the additional V-Bucks and use them to purchase other cosmetics that you may like.

Fortnite Crew Membership Today March, 2024 (Start Date, Price, & Rewards)
February 2024's Fortnite Crew Pack features great perks for subscribers including extra V-Bucks, Battle Pass access, and a new Character Outfit. The Today March, 2024 Fortnite Crew Pack goes live on Today March, 2024 at 7PM EST, bringing great perks and a new set of cosmetics to subscribers. This month’s Crew Pack is being headlined by new character Lana Llane, and features her character Outfit, extra themed cosmetics, and Crew Legacy Styles. Subscribers can also expect their usual set of perks, including premium Battle Pass access and V-Bucks.

All Crew Pack Perks In The Today March, 2024 Fortnite Crew Pack
Crew Pack Perks include:

Access to the premium reward track of the current Fortnite Battle Pass.
1,000 V-Bucks.
Rocket Pass Premium for Rocket League.

The Fortnite Battle Pass contains dozens of season-exclusive cosmetics and packs of V-Bucks. Players who don’t purchase the Battle Pass can collect fewer rewards compared to paid players, who can unlock everything it has to offer. Premium Battle Pass access is great if you enjoy filling out your Locker, and extra v-Bucks are always nice to have. You also receive an extra pack of 1,000 V-Bucks, which you can put towards items in the in-game Item Shop.

The Item Shop has expanded slightly thanks to the arrival of the LEGO Fortnite and Fortnite Festival game modes, so there’s always plenty to buy. Finally, Rocket Pass Premium is essentially Rocket League’s own premium battle pass. This gives you two premium battle passes in one subscription: ideal for players who also enjoy Psyonix’s high-octane car soccer game.

Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide whether to subscribe. The Fortnite Crew offers great value, but only if you’re a dedicated player who spends a lot of time playing the game. Casual players may want to think twice before committing.

What You Have To Know About Fortnite Codes
Be aware that most codes have a very limited number of usages. Some Codes will expire after about 100 usages, and some of them are even only valid once.

But they always exist, the working free Fortnite codes; you just have to know where to look. Therefore, we advise you to keep an eye out for new codes on Twitter. For example, follow reputable leakers like iFireMonkey, Shiina and HYPEX, who will notify you as soon as free codes appear on the Internet. And then you'll just have to be quick!

How to Legitimately Earn V-Bucks

Players can legitimately earn V-Bucks through gameplay in Fortnite’s “Save the World” cooperative mode, completing specific missions, participating in events, or through purchasing them directly in the game. Additionally, each new season of Fortnite typically offers a Battle Pass, which, once purchased, can provide a way to earn enough V-Bucks to purchase the next season’s pass if the player completes enough of the Battle Pass challenges.
